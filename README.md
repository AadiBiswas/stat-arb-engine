# Statistical Arbitrage Engine

**Work in Progress üöß**

## Overview  
This project implements a scalable, modular **statistical arbitrage engine** for cointegrated pairs. Designed for both **academic research** and **pre-production simulation**, it identifies trading opportunities across historical data and backtests mean-reversion strategies with full risk and return metrics.

## Pipeline Architecture  
- **Price Loader**: Downloads and preprocesses historical adjusted-close data.
- **Cointegration Scanner**: Applies Engle-Granger tests across all pair combinations.
- **Spread Constructor**: Uses OLS regression to estimate hedge ratio and build spreads.
- **Signal Generator**: Uses z-score thresholds to trigger long/short positions.
- **Backtester**: Calculates daily returns, cumulative PnL, and strategy diagnostics.

## Metrics (Planned and Ongoing)
- ‚úÖ Cumulative Return  
- ‚úÖ Trade Signals and PnL  
- ‚è≥ Sharpe Ratio  
- ‚è≥ Max Drawdown  
- ‚è≥ Win Ratio, Trade Count  
- ‚è≥ CAGR, Exposure Time  

## Execution Model (Planned)
- Capital base and leverage support  
- Position sizing based on volatility or risk budget  
- Slippage and transaction cost modeling  

## Extensions Under Consideration
- **Batch Pair Evaluation**: Test and rank dozens of pairs by strategy performance.
- **Strategy Config CLI**: User-defined thresholds, lookbacks, filters.
- **ML Meta-Models**: Predict regime shifts, pair success probability, or signal strength.
- **Live Execution Hooks**: Integration with Alpaca, Polygon, or Binance for real-time simulation.

## Goals
- Design modular framework for pair trading strategy simulation.
- Develop interpretable backtest metrics to compare pair performance.
- Extend toward ML-based pair scoring and live execution.
- Optimize for clarity, reproducibility, and extensibility.
